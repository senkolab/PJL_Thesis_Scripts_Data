Ba_4Levels_Shelving_Sim.m: MATLAB script for simulating a time-resolved evolution of the S_1/2, P_1/2, D_3/2 and D_5/2 state populations of a simplified 4-level barium energy level structure.

Ba_4Levels_Shelving_Sim_linsolve.m: MATLAB script for calculating a steady-state solution of the S_1/2, P_1/2, D_3/2 and D_5/2 state populations of a simplified 4-level barium energy level structure.

Misc_Ba_4Levels_FreqScan.m: MATLAB script for computing the steady-state P_1/2 population for a frequency scan of the 1762 nm laser.
